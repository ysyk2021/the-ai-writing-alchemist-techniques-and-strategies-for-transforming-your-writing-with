Another benefit of AI-powered writing tools is increased creativity. These tools can provide students with new ideas and inspiration, helping them break through writer's block and generate new content.

For example, generative models are AI-powered tools that can create new content based on existing data. By using generative models, students can generate new ideas and content with the assistance of AI-powered tools, helping them think outside the box and develop new perspectives on their writing assignments.
